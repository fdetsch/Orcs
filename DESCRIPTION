Description: 
    I tend to repeat the same code chunks over and over again. At first, this 
    was fine for me and I paid little attention to such redundancies. A little 
    later, when I got tired of manually replacing Linux filepaths with the 
    referring Windows versions, and vice versa, I started to stuff some very 
    frequently used work-steps into functions and, even later, into a proper R 
    package. And that's what this package is - a hodgepodge of various R 
    functions meant to simplify (my) everyday-life coding work without, at the 
    same time, being devoted to a particular scope of application.
