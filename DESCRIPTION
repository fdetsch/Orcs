Description: I tend to repeat the same code chunks over and over again. At
    first, this was fine for me and I paid little attention to such redundancies.
    A little later, when I got tired of manually replacing Linux filepaths with
    the referring Windows versions, and vice versa, I started to stuff some very
    frequently used work-steps into functions and, even later, into a proper R
    package. And that's what this package is - a hodgepodge of various R functions
    meant to simplify (my) everyday-life coding work without, at the same time,
    being devoted to a particular scope of application.
