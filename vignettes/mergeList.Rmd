Merging multiple data frames in R is anything but straightforward and usually involves confusing loop structures. `mergeList` elegantly avoids such bewildering code chunks by envoking `Reduce` along with a set of auxiliary parameters passed on to `merge`. Note that the code is mainly taken from a related [blog post in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8091303/merge-multiple-data-frames-in-a-list-simultaneously). 

```{r mergeList, eval=TRUE}
## sample data
set.seed(10)
ls_df <- list(data.frame(a = 1:10, b = 1:10),
              data.frame(a = 5:14, c = 11:20),
              data.frame(a = sample(20, 10), d = runif(10)))

## merge data frames in one go
mergeList(ls_df, by = "a", all = TRUE)
```
